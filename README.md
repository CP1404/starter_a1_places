# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP1804, IT@JCU

By: Nishant_Rana 

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
(`temp.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `places.csv` and want the original data back).  
Assignment 1 requires from me to create a program which allows a user to know what countries they had vistored to help them make a confined
decision on which country they should visit based off the respective countries priority status. If they had already visited that country they can flag it as 'visited', and have the ability to add in names of countries that they want to visit. 
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  

This assignment is tracked using wakatime api. The stats will be added below.
